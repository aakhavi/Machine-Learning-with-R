# Machine-Learning-with-R
This repository is a collection of projects from a Cal Poly graduate course taken in Fall 2021 in Machine Learning for Economics using R
Intro_to_tidymodels.Rmd is a project introducing the "tidymodels" package in R which streamlines model creation 
Logistic_Regression_KNN.Rmd is a project showcasing the difference between logistic models and KNN (nearest neighbor) models
LDA_QDA_SVM.Rmd is a project displaying the results by creating Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) 

There are two Final projects included in the repo:
One is a Random Forest and Neural Network on Categorical data with the aim of having the highest accuracy in the prediction model
One is a Random Forest and Neural Network on Quantatative data with the aim of having the lowest log value of "Sales" which was the variable being predicted by the model
